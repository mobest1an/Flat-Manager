# Flat-Manager
Client-Server application with GUI on client for managing flats. (Only source code)

The server part receives requests from the client, processes them and sends responses. 
Everything happens over the TCP protocol. The client has several features, 
such as a console that supports a number of commands, a table, and a render area.
